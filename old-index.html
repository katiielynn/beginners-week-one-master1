<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
</p>
<h2>
<li> HTML is cool</li>
<br>CSS is cooler</br>
<br>JS is the best</br>
<br>What do you need to create a website?</br>
</h2>

<p>Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files</p>
